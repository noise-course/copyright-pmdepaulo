### Task 1: YouTube's Copyright Policy 
YouTube detects copyright infringement on the platform through several automated mechanisms. Due to the high volume of content on the platform, Google, YouTube’s parent company, uses their own automated copyright identification system called Content ID ([source]https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797370?hl=en). Content ID maintains a vast database of files (both audio and visual) submitted by copyright owners. This allows any video uploaded to YouTube to be scanned against the entire Content ID database until a match is found. 
	
When a match is found, Google creates a Content ID claim. Depending on the preestablished settings of the copyright owner, the video can be monetized for the copyright owner, blocked, or restricted. A Content ID claim is not necessarily a copyright strike necessarily, and manual take-downs can still occur that might lead to a potential copyright strike. The user then has a series of choices for next steps depending on the severity of the copyright owner's settings. They can choose to edit their video and remove any copyrighted material or dispute the claim, which would allow the rights owner to potentially submit a manual (DMCS) take-down request in response. If a user finds that their video has been manually taken down and shouldn't have, they can submit a legal DMCA counter-notification that can potentially force YouTube to put the video back up.

In terms of monetization, there are a few avenues for revenue to be handled if a video has a Claim ID. As mentioned before, a copyright owner's settings can potentially divert all or some revenue to themselves if they believe the Claim ID is valid. 

One special program that exists for YouTube is industry liscensing agreements that mediate agreements upon Claim ID settings and monetization of copyrighted videos.  

### Task 2: Fair Use

## Upload #1: Good Mashup
For the first upload, I chose to upload a transition from “Sports car” by Tate McRae into “Buttons” by the Pussycat Dolls, where the songs do not overlap. Each song can be heard clearly for at least 10 seconds. This has the title “cool mashup!” and is located at this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcgkfHElt0s) (the dog picture was chosen arbitrarily and is not part of the experiment).
[good_mashup_screenshot](images/good_mashup.png)
The video was __instantly__ detected by YouTube/Google’s Content ID detection software, flagging it as having contained copyrighted material before it finished uploading. I found that YouTube runs a set of checks before the video is made available to the public, and since this video was relatively short, it was immediately flagged before I hit publish. YouTube still let me publish the video, but gave me a warning under “Restrictions” with the message: “Copyright-protected content found. People in some countries can’t watch your video.” 
Below is a screenshot of the dashboard notification that the video has Copyright restrictions as well as the “details” page when I looked for more information. The details list out the songs that were detected in my uploaded video, correctly identifying them as “Sports car” and “Buttons”. However, it mentions that this is not a copyright strike, and flags the main point of concern to be a potential lack of visibility in certain countries and a warning about a potential loss of monetization.

However, after investigating further into the claim, I found that only one country has restricted the visibility of my video, which is __Russia__.

Therefore, the final outcome is that this video, which contains clear copyrighted material, was immediately flagged for copyright. However, the video remains visible to the public in all countries except for Russia, and was not officially taken down from YouTube.
In response, YouTube gave me several options to remedy the copyright claim, including erasing the song from the video, replacing the song with a song from YouTube's approved audio library, trimming the segment out of the video, or disputing the claim entirely.

## Upload #2: Terrible Mashup
For the second upload, I chose to (poorly) layer the previously used two songs ("Sports car" by Tate McRae and "Buttons" by The Pussycat Dolls) over each other such that neither are isolated at any point in the video. 
[bad_mashup_screenshot](images/bad_mashup.png)
The video was scanned by YouTube and was found to contain __no__ copyright material, and the video did not get restricted in any form. Below are the details from the "Copyright" tab of the dashboard like in the previous example, but with no content detected. 
[copyright_details_bad](images/copyright_details_bad.png)
As of four days from the date of upload, no copyright warnings or detections have been made, and there is no action to be taken since the video is still visible and accessible in all parts of the world. 

### Task 3: AI-Generated Content Investigation

## Upload #1: Direct Reference
For the first of the two varying degrees of similarity to copyrighted works, I chose to prompt Suno (an AI song generator) for a song inspired by the same one tested in the previous Fair Use experiments: "Sports car" by Tate McRae. Since I found that Suno does not permit artist names in any prompts, I used the following prompt: __"Generate a song in the style of the song 'Sports car'"__. This generated a song similar in message and style to "Sports car", which I posted to YouTube with a picture of Tate McRae as the cover. 
[ai_sports_car](images/ai_sports_car.png)
YouTube had no response to this upload over the course of the past 48 hours, and it did not receive any sort of warnings or even detections of copyright material. However, it did get 150 views and 3 likes!
[ai_sports_car](images/ai_sports_car_copyright.png)
According to Suno's [Terms of Service](https://about.suno.com/terms), any AI-generated song created under the __free__ tier of the platform is suitable for non-commercial, personal purposes. Since this is the tier that I am operating under for this experiment, these are the regulations that would apply to my upload specifically. Under Suno's paid tier, they grant you access to all rights that __Suno__ holds to the generated output, meaning that any rights that Suno would have over the song it creates would be passed onto the user (for the paid tier). However, copyright for a piece of music requires a human author, and __purely__ AI-generated music does not currently hold the eligibility for copyright protection/rights. 
Overall, Suno contractually passes over the rights that it holds to the song for any __paid__ tier member, but free tier users (such as myself) are only permitted to use the song for personal and non-commercial use, which includes posting to YouTube (and not monetizing off of the video).
In regards to AI generated material being posted to YouTube's platform, the site does not have any enforced ban or restriction on AI generated content, so long as any potentially harmful or misleading information is [disclosed](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/14328491?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid) using the "altered content" setting. However, this only applies to specific kinds of content generated, which mainly encompasses altering or fabricating realistic scenes or events. AI content is also still eligible for monetization on YouTube, as long as it's in accordance with YouTube's requirements. 

## Upload #2: Original Creation
For my second upload, I chose another degree of similarity to copyrighted content: none at all. For my original (or non-mimicking) AI song, I gave Suno the prompt: "make a hyperpop song about being addicted to diet coke".
[diet_coke](images/diet_coke.png)
Like the previous AI generated song that I uploaded, this one did not receive any warnings or copyright flags.
[diet_coke_analytics](images/diet_coke_analytics.png)
Since the same AI rules and regulations apply as discussed above, a song that is further from a copyrighted work is less likely to flag anything on YouTube's platform. After several days, no warnings have been received and neither videos have been asked to disclose for AI use. 

### Task 4: Legal Analysis

## Fair Use Four Factors - Upload #1 (Good Mashup)
1) Purpose and character of the use
The purpose and character of the use for this first upload is to present a mashup that the user made (which contained copyrighted music). It was not to profit off of either of the original songs or the mashup itself, and was not trying to mimic any original singer.
2) Nature of the copyrighted work (creative vs. factual?)
The nature of the copyrighted works are an original creative songs that were written by several authors and contain unique melodies and lyrics. Since these songs are not factual, the mashups derive from deeply creative material, leaning against Fair Use. 
3) Amount and substantiality used
Only parts of both songs were used, and neither song was completed in its entirety for the duration of the video. Since the songs are short and fragmented, it leans in favor of Fair Use. 
4) Effect on the market for the original
This video creates no effect on the market for the original, as it does not detract from the full version of the song and is not providing the audience with either entire songs for free (which could impact the market value). 

## Fair Use Four Factors - Upload #2 (Bad Mashup)
1) Purpose and character of the use
The purpose and character of the use for this first upload is also to present a "mashup" that the user made. It was not to profit off of either of the original songs or the mashup itself, and was not trying to mimic any original singer.
2) Nature of the copyrighted work (creative vs. factual?)
The nature of the copyrighted works are an original creative songs that were written by several authors and contain unique melodies and lyrics. Since these songs are not factual, the mashups derive from deeply creative material, leaning against Fair Use. 
3) Amount and substantiality used
Since both songs are terribly layered over one another, it is hard to distinctly make out just one of them, and muddles the sound. However, the full songs were used in their entirety (instead of just fragments), which harms the arugment for Fair Use in this case. 
4) Effect on the market for the original
This video creates no effect on the market for the original, as it does not detract from the un-mashed version of the song at all. Since neither songs are clear and distinct, the mashup has no ability to act as a replacement for the originals, leaning towards Fair Use since no audience will be stolen from the monetized original works.

## Gap Analysis

Since copyright law typically defers to the copyright owner's preferences and concerns about how their copyrighted material is used, YouTube's protocol aligns with this. YouTube gives the owner complete control over the visibility, lifespan, and revenue of a video that contains their copyrighted material. It allows for several degrees of action to be taken on both the user and owner's ends, and can escalate to legal levels if needed. 
I also did not notice a gap in YouTube's Content ID policy and what I observed in these experiments. The only video that contained clear and distinct parts of copyrighted material was flagged and identified, and in accordance with the copyright owner's settings, gave me (the user) a set of warnings and next steps. This is aligned with the Claim/Content ID process discussed earlier, indicating that YouTube's process for identifying copyrighted material is aligned with both the legal theory and stated platform policy.
